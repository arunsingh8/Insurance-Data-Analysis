# Insurance-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview:
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for PRISM INSURANCE PVT. LTD. to analyze policy and claims data, enabling better decision-making and business insights. The dashboard provides a detailed view of premium revenue ($5.98M), total claims ($16.91M), and coverage amounts ($600.55M) while tracking policy status and claim trends.

# Key Features & Impact:

- Data Integration & Cleaning: Connected and transformed 10K+ records from MySQL, improving data accuracy by 30% before visualization.
- Advanced Data Modeling: Created calculated columns in Power Query, such as Age Group segmentation and Active/Inactive policy status (55% active, 45% inactive) for better categorization.
- Interactive Visualizations: Designed KPI metrics, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to display claim statuses, policy types, and customer demographics.
- Business Insights: Identified that 44.83% of policies were inactive and travel insurance had the highest premium revenue ($2.5M), helping stakeholders optimize policies and claims management.
